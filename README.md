# TexVault

TexVault is a LaTex editor and compiler app. I made this because I was using Overleaf and did not like how long the compile times were and how it had no offline capabilities. Thus, I created TexVault so students can write LaTex notes and research papers anytime, anywhere without the hassle of being connected to a cellular hotspot or waiting minutes to compile their pdf.
